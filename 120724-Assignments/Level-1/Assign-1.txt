Q1. What is a NoSQL Database, and explain the types of NoSQL database? 
ANS: => A NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data 
        that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL 
        databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, high user loads, and frequent schema changes. 
        They are typically used in applications where traditional relational databases may not be suitable due 
        to their limitations in handling unstructured data, scalability, and flexibility.

        There are several types of NoSQL databases, each designed for specific use cases:-----

        Document Databases:
        Description:- Store data in JSON-like documents where each document can have a different structure.
        Use Cases:- Content management systems, user profiles, catalogs.
        Examples:- MongoDB, CouchDB.

        Key-Value Stores:
        Description:- Store data as a collection of key-value pairs where the key is unique, and the value can be any type of data.
        Use Cases:- Session storage, caching, real-time recommendations.
        Examples:- Redis, DynamoDB, Riak.

        Column-Family Stores:
        Description:- Store data in columns instead of rows, allowing for efficient read and write operations on large datasets.
        Use Cases:- Real-time analytics, logging, counters.
        Examples:- Cassandra, HBase.

        Graph Databases:
        Description:- Store data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) to represent complex relationships between data points.
        Use Cases:- Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines.
        Examples:- Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB.

        *data models, 
        *scalability, 
        *schemas, 
        *consistency, 
        *use cases

        # Data Models::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Use a structured data model with tables, rows, and columns.
        -> Data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.
        -> Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

        NoSQL Databases:--
        -> Use a variety of data models including key-value pairs, documents, column families, and graphs.
        -> Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.
        -> Example: MongoDB (Document), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Column-Family), Neo4j (Graph).
-------------------------------------------->>>
        # Scalability::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Typically scale vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server.
        -> Some SQL databases support horizontal scaling but require more complex configurations (e.g., sharding).

        NoSQL Databases:--
        -> Designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to the database cluster.
        -> Handle large volumes of data and high traffic efficiently.
-------------------------------------------->>>        
        # Schemas::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Use a predefined schema that must be defined before data can be inserted.
        -> Schema changes require migrations, which can be complex and time-consuming.

        NoSQL Databases:--
        -> Often schema-less, allowing for more flexibility in data storage.
        -> Each document or record can have a different structure, making it easier to evolve the data model.
-------------------------------------------->>>                
        # Consistency and Transactions::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure reliable transactions.
        -> Strong consistency and support for complex transactions.

        NoSQL Databases:--
        -> Many NoSQL databases follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) model.
        -> Eventual consistency means that data changes are propagated to all nodes eventually, but not necessarily immediately.
        -> Some NoSQL databases offer options for strong consistency.
-------------------------------------------->>>        
        # Query Language::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.
        -> Powerful and versatile query capabilities.
        
        NoSQL Databases:--
        -> Each NoSQL database may have its own query language or API.
        -> Queries are often simpler and designed to be executed quickly.
-------------------------------------------->>>  
        # Use Cases::--->>>

        SQL Databases:--
        -> Best suited for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and structured data.

Q4. What are collections and documents in a MongoDB database? 
ANS: => In MongoDB, the primary way of organizing and storing data is through collections and documents. 
        Understanding these concepts is fundamental to working with MongoDB. Here’s an overview:

        ### Collections
        - **Definition**: A collection in MongoDB is a grouping of MongoDB documents. It is akin to a table in a relational database.

        - **Characteristics**:
        - Collections are schema-less, meaning that the documents within a collection do not need to have the same structure or fields.
        - Collections do not enforce any structure on the documents they contain.
        - Collections are created implicitly when a document is inserted into them. If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates it 
          when you first store data.

        ### Documents
        - **Definition**: A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB. It is a record in a collection, analogous to a row in a table 
                          in a relational database.
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Documents are composed of field-value pairs, where fields are similar to columns in a relational database, and values can 
          be various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and other documents.
        - Documents use a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for rich data types and easy data interchange.
        - Each document typically contains an `_id` field, which acts as a primary key and uniquely identifies the document within a 
          collection.

        ### Example:
        Consider a collection named `users` that stores information about users. Here are a few example documents that could be
        in the `users` collection:
        {
        "_id": "1",
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Wonderland"
        },
        "interests": ["reading", "hiking"]
        }

        {
        "_id": "2",
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 25,
        "email": "bob@example.com",
        "address": {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Springfield"
        },
        "interests": ["cooking", "cycling"]
        }
        Collections and documents are core to MongoDB’s NoSQL approach, offering a flexible and dynamic way to store and manage 
        data compared to traditional relational databases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>>
Q5. What is BSON? What is the difference between BSON and JSON? 
ANS: => BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It extends the JSON model to provide 
        additional data types and to be efficient for encoding and decoding within various languages.

        ### BSON------
        - **Definition**: BSON stands for Binary JSON. It is a binary representation of JSON documents.

        - **Purpose**: Designed to be both human-readable and efficient for machine parsing. It allows MongoDB to store and 
                       query data more efficiently.

        - **Features**:----
        - **Additional Data Types**: Supports more data types than JSON, including Date, 32-bit integer, 64-bit integer, 
                                     floating-point, binary data, and more.
        - **Efficiency**: Optimized for speed and space, making it faster to encode and decode, and more compact in storage 
                          compared to plain JSON.
        - **Extensibility**: Can be extended with custom data types.

        ### JSON------
        - **Definition**: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight, text-based format for data interchange.

        - **Purpose**: Designed to be easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

        - **Features**:
        - **Human-Readable**: Easily readable and writable by humans, commonly used for configuration files, data exchange between 
                              web clients and servers, etc.
        - **Standard Data Types**: Supports basic data types like string, number, boolean, array, object (map/dictionary), and null.
        - **Text Format**: Plain text format, which can be larger and slower to parse compared to binary formats.

        ### Differences Between BSON and JSON ::----

Q7. How to create collections in MongoDB?
ANS: => Creating collections in MongoDB can be done using either the MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`) or MongoDB Compass. Here's how to 
        create collections using both methods:

        ### Using MongoDB Shell (mongosh)
        MongoDB Shell provides a straightforward way to create collections using commands. You can either create a collection explicitly 
        or implicitly by inserting a document into a collection that doesn't yet exist.

        #### Explicitly Creating a Collection
        To explicitly create a collection, use the `createCollection` method:
        ```shell::---
        use myDatabase
        db.createCollection("myCollection")
        ```
        In this example:----
        - `use myDatabase` switches to (or creates) the database named `myDatabase`.
        - `db.createCollection("myCollection")` creates a collection named `myCollection` within `myDatabase`.

        #### Implicitly Creating a Collection
        You can also create a collection implicitly by inserting a document into a non-existent collection:
        ```shell
        use myDatabase
        db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
        ```
        In this example:
        - `use myDatabase` switches to (or creates) the database named `myDatabase`.
        - `db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })` inserts a document into `myCollection`. If `myCollection` 
           does not exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.

        ### Using MongoDB Compass::------
        MongoDB Compass offers a visual way to create collections without writing code.

        #### Steps to Create a Collection in MongoDB Compass:
        1. **Open MongoDB Compass** and connect to your MongoDB instance.
        2. **Navigate to the Database**: Select the database where you want to create the collection. If the database doesn't exist, you can create it by entering the name.
        3. **Create Collection**:
        - Click on the **"Create Collection"** button.
        - In the dialog that appears, enter the name of the new collection.
        - Optionally, configure additional options such as validation rules, capped collections, and size limits.
        - Click **"Create Collection"** to finalize.

        ### Example Walkthrough for MongoDB Compass
        1. **Connect**: Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your MongoDB instance.
        2. **Select Database**: From the left-hand sidebar, select the desired database or create a new one.
        3. **Create Collection**: 
        - Click the **"Collections"** tab to view existing collections.
        - Click the **"Create Collection"** button.
        - Enter the collection name, for example, `myCollection`.
        - Optionally, configure collection options (e.g., validation, capped collection).
        - Click **"Create Collection"**.

        ### Summary
        - **MongoDB Shell**: Use `db.createCollection("collectionName")` to explicitly create a collection or `db.collectionName.insertOne(document)` to implicitly create one by inserting a document.
        - **MongoDB Compass**: Use the visual interface to create a collection by navigating to the database and using the "Create Collection" button.

        Both methods offer flexibility, allowing you to choose between a command-line interface for scripting and automation, or a graphical interface for ease of use and visual data management.

Q8. What is the difference between insertMany and insertOne?
ANS: => In MongoDB, `insertOne` and `insertMany` are methods used to insert documents into a collection. They differ primarily in the number of documents they are designed to insert at a time and the way they handle the insertion process.

        ### `insertOne`:::---------
        - **Purpose**: Inserts a single document into a collection.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.insertOne(document)`
        - The `document` parameter is a single JSON-like object representing the document to be inserted.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.insertOne({
        name: "Alice",
        age: 30,
        email: "alice@example.com"
        })
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Simple and straightforward for inserting a single document.
        - Returns a result object containing information about the inserted document, such as the inserted `_id`.

        ### `insertMany`::------
        - **Purpose**: Inserts multiple documents into a collection in a single operation.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.insertMany([document1, document2, ...])`
        - The parameter is an array of JSON-like objects, each representing a document to be inserted.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.insertMany([
        {
        name: "Bob",
        age: 25,
        email: "bob@example.com"
        },
        {
        name: "Carol",
        age: 28,
        email: "carol@example.com"
        }
        ])
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Efficient for inserting multiple documents at once.
        - Returns a result object containing information about the inserted documents, such as the inserted IDs.
        - Provides options for ordered and unordered bulk insertions:
        - **Ordered**: Inserts documents in the order they are provided. If an error occurs, the operation stops at the first error (default behavior).
        - **Unordered**: Inserts documents in any order, continuing the insertion process even if some documents cause errors.

        ### Key Differences
        | Feature                    | `insertOne`                                   | `insertMany`                                                          |
        |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------                     |
        | **Number of Documents**    | Single document                               | Multiple documents                                                    |
        | **Syntax**                 | `db.collection.insertOne(document)`           | `db.collection.insertMany([document1, document2])`                    |
        | **Return Value**           | Information about the single inserted document| Information about all inserted documents                              |
        | **Efficiency**             | Best for single document insertion            | More efficient for bulk insertion                                     |
        | **Error Handling**         | Stops at the first error                      | Can be ordered (stop at first error) or unordered (continue on error) |

        ### Use Cases
        - **`insertOne`**:
        - Use when you need to insert a single document.
        - Ideal for scenarios where insertions are infrequent or when handling individual documents.
        
        - **`insertMany`**:
        - Use when you need to insert multiple documents in one operation.
        - Suitable for bulk data insertion, improving performance by reducing the number of round trips to the server.

        ### Example Walkthrough:
        1. **Using `insertOne`**:
        ```javascript
        db.products.insertOne({
        name: "Laptop",
        brand: "BrandA",
        price: 999.99
        })
        ```
        This inserts a single product document into the `products` collection.

        2. **Using `insertMany`**:
        ```javascript
        db.products.insertMany([
        {
        name: "Smartphone",
        brand: "BrandB",
        price: 599.99
        },
        {
        name: "Tablet",
        brand: "BrandC",
        price: 299.99
        }
        ])
        ```
        This inserts two product documents into the `products` collection in a single operation.

        Choosing between `insertOne` and `insertMany` depends on the specific requirements of your application, particularly the number of documents you need to insert and how you want to handle the insertion process.

Q9. What is the difference between deleteOne and deleteMany?
ANS: => In MongoDB, `deleteOne` and `deleteMany` are methods used to remove documents from a collection. They differ in terms of the number of documents they are designed to delete based on the specified filter.

        ### `deleteOne`
        - **Purpose**: Deletes a single document from a collection that matches the given filter criteria.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.deleteOne(filter)`
        - The `filter` parameter specifies the criteria for selecting the document to delete.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Deletes the first document that matches the filter criteria.
        - Returns a result object that includes the count of deleted documents (which will be 1 or 0) and a boolean indicating whether the operation was acknowledged.

        ### `deleteMany`
        - **Purpose**: Deletes all documents from a collection that match the given filter criteria.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.deleteMany(filter)`
        - The `filter` parameter specifies the criteria for selecting the documents to delete.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.deleteMany({ age: { $gte: 30 } })
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.
        - Returns a result object that includes the count of deleted documents and a boolean indicating whether the operation was acknowledged.

        ### Key Differences
        | Feature                     | `deleteOne`                                      | `deleteMany`                                   |
        |-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
        | **Number of Documents**     | Deletes a single matching document               | Deletes all matching documents                 |
        | **Syntax**                  | `db.collection.deleteOne(filter)`                | `db.collection.deleteMany(filter)`             |
        | **Return Value**            | Information about the single deleted document    | Information about all deleted documents        |
        | **Use Case**                | When you want to delete one specific document    | When you want to delete multiple documents     |
        | **Performance**             | More efficient for single deletions              | More efficient for bulk deletions              |

        ### Use Cases
        - **`deleteOne`**:
        - Use when you need to delete a single document that matches specific criteria.
        - Ideal for operations where you are certain there is only one document to delete or you want to delete only the first match.

        - **`deleteMany`**:
        - Use when you need to delete multiple documents that match specific criteria.
        - Suitable for bulk deletions where many documents match the given filter.

        ### Example Walkthrough
        1. **Using `deleteOne`**:
        ```javascript
        // Delete a single user document where the name is "Alice"
        db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
        ```
        This deletes the first document in the `users` collection where the `name` field is "Alice".

        2. **Using `deleteMany`**:
        ```javascript
        // Delete all user documents where the age is greater than or equal to 30
        db.users.deleteMany({ age: { $gte: 30 } })
        ```
        This deletes all documents in the `users` collection where the `age` field is 30 or higher.

        ### Summary
        - **`deleteOne`** is used to delete the first document that matches the specified filter criteria, making it suitable for single deletions.
        - **`deleteMany`** is used to delete all documents that match the specified filter criteria, making it suitable for bulk deletions.

        Choosing between `deleteOne` and `deleteMany` depends on the specific requirements of your application, particularly the number of documents you need to delete based on the filter criteria.

Q10. How to read data in MongoDB? What is the difference between find and findOne?
ANS: => Reading data in MongoDB involves using queries to retrieve documents from collections. MongoDB provides methods like `find` and `findOne` for this purpose. These methods allow you to search for documents based on specified criteria.

        ### Using `find` and `findOne`

        #### `find`
        - **Purpose**: Retrieves multiple documents that match the given filter criteria.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.find(query, projection)`
        - The `query` parameter specifies the filter criteria to match documents.
        - The `projection` parameter specifies the fields to include or exclude in the returned documents.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 30 } }, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Returns a cursor to the matching documents, allowing you to iterate over the results.
        - Can return multiple documents.
        - Supports additional options like sorting, limiting, and skipping results.

        #### `findOne`
        - **Purpose**: Retrieves a single document that matches the given filter criteria.
        - **Usage**:
        - Syntax: `db.collection.findOne(query, projection)`
        - The `query` parameter specifies the filter criteria to match the document.
        - The `projection` parameter specifies the fields to include or exclude in the returned document.
        - **Example**:
        ```javascript
        db.users.findOne({ name: "Alice" }, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })
        ```
        - **Characteristics**:
        - Returns the first matching document.
        - Can be more efficient when you only need a single document.
        - Useful for queries where you expect a unique result or want to check for the existence of a document.

        ### Key Differences

        | Feature                    | `find`                                      | `findOne`                                      |
        |----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        | **Purpose**                | Retrieve multiple matching documents        | Retrieve a single matching document           |
        | **Return Type**            | Cursor to the matching documents            | Single document                               |
        | **Usage Syntax**           | `db.collection.find(query, projection)`     | `db.collection.findOne(query, projection)`    |
        | **Efficiency**             | May be less efficient for single document retrieval | More efficient for single document retrieval  |
        | **Iteration**              | Requires iteration over results             | Directly returns the document                 |
        | **Common Use Cases**       | Bulk data retrieval, complex queries        | Unique queries, existence checks              |

        ### Example Walkthrough

        1. **Using `find`**:
        ```javascript
        // Find all users aged 30 or older, returning only their names and ages
        var cursor = db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 30 } }, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })
        cursor.forEach(doc => printjson(doc))
        ```
        This retrieves all documents in the `users` collection where the `age` field is 30 or higher and prints their names and ages.

        2. **Using `findOne`**:
        ```javascript
        // Find a single user with the name "Alice", returning only her name and age
        var user = db.users.findOne({ name: "Alice" }, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })
        printjson(user)
        ```
        This retrieves the first document in the `users` collection where the `name` field is "Alice" and prints her name and age.

        ### Reading Data in MongoDB Compass
        In MongoDB Compass, reading data is done through the visual interface:

        1. **Open MongoDB Compass** and connect to your MongoDB instance.
        2. **Select the Database and Collection**: Navigate to the database and collection you want to query.
        3. **Run a Query**:
        - Click on the "Documents" tab to view documents.
        - Enter your query in the query bar, such as `{ age: { $gte: 30 } }`.
        - Optionally, specify the projection to include or exclude fields.
        - Click "Find" to execute the query and view the results.

        ### Summary
        - **`find`** is used to retrieve multiple documents and returns a cursor for iteration. It is suitable for bulk data retrieval and complex queries.
        - **`findOne`** is used to retrieve a single document and directly returns the document. It is efficient for unique queries and existence checks.

        Both methods allow for flexible and powerful querying in MongoDB, depending on the specific needs of your application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>>
Q11. What is $set in MongoDB?
ANS: => In MongoDB, `$set` is an update operator used to modify the value of specific fields in a document. If the field does not exist, `$set` adds the field with the specified value. This operator is commonly used in update operations to change one or more fields without affecting other fields in the document.

        ### Usage of `$set`

        #### Basic Syntax
        ```javascript
        db.collection.updateOne(
        { filter },
        { $set: { field1: value1, field2: value2, ... } }
        )
        ```
        - **`filter`**: The criteria to match the document(s) to be updated.
        - **`$set`**: The update operator that specifies the fields to be updated and their new values.

        ### Example Scenarios

        #### Updating a Single Field
        To update a single field in a document, use the `updateOne` method with the `$set` operator:
        ```javascript
        // Update the age of the user with the name "Alice" to 31
        db.users.updateOne(
        { name: "Alice" },
        { $set: { age: 31 } }
        )
        ```
        This updates the `age` field of the first document where the `name` is "Alice" to 31.

        #### Updating Multiple Fields
        You can use `$set` to update multiple fields at once:
        ```javascript
        // Update the age and email of the user with the name "Bob"
        db.users.updateOne(
        { name: "Bob" },
        { $set: { age: 26, email: "bob.new@example.com" } }
        )
        ```
        This updates both the `age` and `email` fields of the first document where the `name` is "Bob".

        #### Adding a New Field
        If the field specified in `$set` does not exist in the document, MongoDB will add the field:
        ```javascript
        // Add a new field 'status' to the user with the name "Carol"
        db.users.updateOne(
        { name: "Carol" },
        { $set: { status: "active" } }
        )
        ```
        This adds a new field `status` with the value `"active"` to the first document where the `name` is "Carol".

        ### Using `$set` in `updateMany`
        To update multiple documents that match a filter, use the `updateMany` method with `$set`:
        ```javascript
        // Update the status of all users aged 30 or older to "senior"
        db.users.updateMany(
        { age: { $gte: 30 } },
        { $set: { status: "senior" } }
        )
        ```
        This updates the `status` field to `"senior"` for all documents where the `age` is 30 or higher.

        ### Using `$set` in `findOneAndUpdate`
        To update a document and return the updated document, use the `findOneAndUpdate` method:
        ```javascript
        // Update the age of the user with the name "Alice" and return the updated document
        db.users.findOneAndUpdate(
        { name: "Alice" },
        { $set: { age: 32 } },
        { returnDocument: "after" }
        )
        ```
        This updates the `age` field of the first document where the `name` is "Alice" to 32 and returns the updated document.

        ### Summary
        - **`$set`** is an update operator used to modify specific fields in a document.
        - **Usage**: Commonly used in update operations like `updateOne`, `updateMany`, and `findOneAndUpdate`.
        - **Functionality**: Updates the value of specified fields or adds the field if it does not exist.
        - **Examples**:
        - Updating a single field: `db.users.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })`
        - Updating multiple fields: `db.users.updateOne({ name: "Bob" }, { $set: { age: 26, email: "bob.new@example.com" } })`
        - Adding a new field: `db.users.updateOne({ name: "Carol" }, { $set: { status: "active" } })`
        - Updating multiple documents: `db.users.updateMany({ age: { $gte: 30 } }, { $set: { status: "senior" } })`

        By using `$set`, you can efficiently update specific fields in MongoDB documents without altering other parts of the document.

                { name: "John" }
        ]
        })
        ```

        4. **Array Query Operators**:
        - `$in`: Matches any of the values specified in an array
        - `$nin`: Matches none of the values specified in an array
        - `$all`: Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query

        ```javascript

        ```javascript
        Model.find({ key: value }, function(err, docs) {
        // handle docs
        });
        ```

        2. **Using Comparison Operators**:
        ```javascript
        Model.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }, function(err, docs) {
        // handle docs
        });
        ```

        3. **Logical Operators**:
        ```javascript
        Model.find({
        $or: [
                { age: { $lt: 30 } },
                { name: "John" }
        ]
        }, function(err, docs) {
        // handle docs
        });
        ```

        4. **Array Query Operators**:
        ```javascript
        Model.find({ tags: { $in: ["red", "blue"] } }, function(err, docs) {
        // handle docs
        });
        ```

        5. **Element Operators**:

        ### Example Code with Mongoose

        ```javascript
        const mongoose = require('mongoose');

        const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        name: String,
        age: Number,
        tags: [String]
        });

        const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

        // Connecting to the database
        mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

        // Filtering documents
        User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }, (err, users) => {
        if (err) return console.error(err);
        console.log(users);
        });

        // Closing the connection
        mongoose.connection.close();
        ```

        These examples should help you get started with filtering data in MongoDB both in the shell and using Mongoose in a Node.js application.
